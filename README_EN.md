## 🔍 Project Background

Even now, countless pieces of information are pouring in every day from various sources —  
including news, online communities, and social media platforms.  
Searching and comparing each one manually consumes a great deal of time and effort.

**TrendFusion AI was created to reduce the fatigue of consuming too much information.**  
Upon user request, the system crawls the web to collect the most recent content on a specific topic.  
That content is then translated and summarized fluently by a generative AI model,  
allowing users to instantly compare the latest public reactions on the topic.
